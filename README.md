# ECEN 758 Group 31 Project
## Abstract
The goal of this project is to explore the [FashionMNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset, and build a data mining pipeline starting from data cleansing to classification. 
For the first part we used dimensionality reduction technique to better visualize the distribution of data, and also find potential pattern that can help deciding our choice of model and learning method.
